The WinCC OA DemoApplication is a simple WinCC OA project that 
implements a number of process control and visualization 
tasks from different sectors of automation technology by way 
of example. It is primarily intended for demonstration 
purposes and for giving an initial insight into the range of
facilities offered by WinCC OA . However this application can 
also be used as an introductory manual for users taking their
 first steps in creating their own WinCC OA projects. The 
DemoApplication can certainly be applied to numerous smaller 
project exercises and used as a basis for new projects.Some 
of the different scenarios originate from real applications 
and have merely been simplified, while others have been made
 up as imaginary situations. In either case, the interfaces,
 contents and data structures are only intended for 
demonstration, and should in no way be seen as bearing too 
close a relationship with reality.
